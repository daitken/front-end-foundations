/*  Description:

    Leverage your knowledge of the JavaScript programming language
    to create a program which will concatenate the strings together
    to form your birthday.

    You'll need to create three variables named day, month, and year
    and then assign each of those variables to a fourth variable named 
    myBirthday. When you assign the variables to myBirthday make sure 
    they are in the appropriate order and format. Finally, print the 
    variable myBirthday to the console to see if you have the format 
    identical to the one in the example below.

    Example: If your birthday is November 11th of 1991 then the format
    should be November 11, 1991

    Fill in the empty strings ("") with the appropriate information.

let day = "17";
let month = "July";
let year = "1956";

let myBirthday = month + " " + day + ", " + year;
console.log(myBirthday);
